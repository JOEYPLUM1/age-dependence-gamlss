## Goals of this demo
1. Share GAMLSS code examples via this interactive notebook.
2. Assess the dependence of age.
3. Account for age dependence in gas-exchange binned analysis.

## Motivation for this work
The Xe-MRI community uses several methods to perform image analysis. The most trivial method is to simply calculate the median signal intensity, $\mu$, of the voxels of a disease subject. However, this method only provides a global overview of a subject's voxels, and is likely to be insensitive to small changes caused by disease (which is what we are fundamentally interested in).

Thus, many studies implement a linear binning (LB) technique to make statistical comparisons {Z. Wang, *et. al.* 2017}. The LB method assumes that, for an aggregated healthy-reference cohort, the voxel-wise signal intensities of a gas-exchange metric, $\textbf{y}$, fits a normal distribution, described by:
\begin{equation}
\textbf{y}\sim N(\mu, \sigma)
\end{equation}
where $\sigma$ is the variation. Note, bold typeface represents a vector (lowercase) or matrix (uppercase), and non-bold typeface represents scalar values. Subsequently, statistical inferences are made by calculating the fractions of the lung that fall into each z-score (percentile) bin (-2, -1, 0, +1, +2) of the healthy normal distribution.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Choose a range of signal intensities to simulate distribution over:
simulated_locations <- seq(0, 1, length.out = 200)

# Simulate a normal distribution:
simulated_distributions <- data.frame(indx = simulated_locations)
simulated_distributions$normal_base <- dNO(
  x = simulated_locations,
  mu = 0.4,
  sigma = (0.3)^2
)

# Simulate another normal distribution:
simulated_distributions$normal_perturbed <- dNO(
  x = simulated_locations,
  mu = 0.6,
  sigma = (0.25)^2
)

# Plot the distributions:
ggplot() +
  geom_path(data = simulated_distributions,
            aes(x = indx,
                y = normal_base),
            color = "Black",
            linetype = "solid",
            size = 1.5,
            na.rm = TRUE) +
  geom_path(data = simulated_distributions,
            aes(x = indx,
                y = normal_perturbed),
            color = "darkgreen",
            linetype = "dashed",
            size = 1.5,
            na.rm = TRUE) +
  ggtitle("Example normal distributions") + 
  theme(legend.position = "right") +
  xlab('Signal intensity (A.U.)') +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(color = "black", size = 18),
        axis.title.y = element_blank(),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 16),
        legend.key.width = unit(1, 'cm'),
        title = element_text(size = 16),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 16),
        plot.margin = unit(c(0, 0, 0, 0), "mm")) 
```

A generalized linear-binning (GLB) method was later proposed to account for skew, by using a Box-Cox transformation to transform a skewed distribution into a normal distribution {M. He, *et. al.* 2017. Once transformed, the same z-score approach can then be implemented and then transformed back into its original distribution. An equivalent way to represent this transformation is to fit $y$ to a Box-Cox Cole-Green distribution:
\begin{equation}
\textbf{y}\sim BCCG(\mu,\sigma,\nu)
\end{equation}
where $\nu$ is the distribution skew, equal to the Box-Cox transform power used in the transformation.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Choose a range of signal intensities to simulate distribution over:
simulated_locations <- seq(0, 1, length.out = 200)

# Simulate a normal distribution:
simulated_distributions <- data.frame(indx = simulated_locations)
simulated_distributions$BCCG_base <- dBCCG(
  x = simulated_locations,
  mu = 0.4,
  sigma = 0.3,
  nu = 1
)

# Simulate another normal distribution:
simulated_distributions$BCCG_perturbed <- dBCCG(
  x = simulated_locations,
  mu = 0.6,
  sigma = 0.25,
  nu = 2
)

# Plot the distributions:
ggplot() +
  geom_path(data = simulated_distributions,
            aes(x = indx,
                y = BCCG_base),
            color = "Black",
            linetype = "solid",
            size = 1.5,
            na.rm = TRUE) +
  geom_path(data = simulated_distributions,
            aes(x = indx,
                y = BCCG_perturbed),
            color = "darkgreen",
            linetype = "dashed",
            size = 1.5,
            na.rm = TRUE) +
  ggtitle("Example BCCG distributions") + 
  theme(legend.position = "right") +
  xlab('Signal intensity (A.U.)') +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(color = "black", size = 18),
        axis.title.y = element_blank(),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 16),
        legend.key.width = unit(1, 'cm'),
        title = element_text(size = 16),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 16),
        plot.margin = unit(c(0, 0, 0, 0), "mm")) 
```

To date, the above methods have assumed constant distribution parameters (median, variance, and skew), and thus a constant healthy-reference distribution. However, pulmonary structure and function are known to vary substantially with demographic variables, like *age*.

**Our proposal**

To expand prior methods, we propose a method that fits $\textbf{y}$ to a Box-Cox power-exponential distribution, that is dependent on all possible distribution parameters (median, variance, skew, and kurtosis). Furthermore, we use GAMLSS methods to make our fitted distribution flexible to some explanatory variable, $\textbf{x}$, which in our case is age. This can be described by:

\begin{equation}
\textbf{y}\sim BCPE(\textbf{$\mu$},\textbf{\sigma},\textbf{\nu},\textbf{\tau})
\end{equation}

The final distribution parameter, $\tau$, represents kurtosis. The bold typeface is used to show the non-scalar (vector) type of the parameter. Prior methods asssumed a constant distribution, so a scalar distribution parameter set could be used, while this proposed method fits to a flexible age-dependent parameter set, given by vectors. The mathematics behind this is discussed in some detail in our paper, with extensive details in the GAMLSS book: [A flexible regression approach using GAMLSS
in R](https://www.gamlss.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/book-2010-Athens1.pdf).

## Import data
We will be using randomly sampled RBC:membrane (ratio) data from a range of subjects at Cincinnati Children's Hospital. All personal information has been removed, and only 500 voxels were sampled per subject.
